# Short Description:

This project represents my activity as a summer intern at Faculty of Automation Control and Computers from University of Politehnica Bucharest.

The main focus of this project is to predict if responses from twitter are generated by a human or a bot using machine learning algorithms and NLP techniques.

In order to get the best performance we tried out some several approaches which will be described bellow.

# Motivation: 

Given the fact that bots are more and more present among us on social networks, trying to detect them using their responses to some subjects, could help a lot for further researches on social media regarding human behavior or public opinions, excluding the bots as much as possible.


# Dataset:

The dataset was taken from kaggle (www.kaggle.com/c/human-or-machine-generated-text/data) and is consisted from 3 files: train, validation and test. 

The files contains 4 fields each, except train, which has no flag values: 
Indexing field
Context field ( is always human generated and represents a dialogue between multiple speakers)
Response field( can be either human or bot generated)
Human-generated field ( a flag which indicates if response is human generated [1] or not [0])

Train contains around 7 millions lines, being a balanced dataset (50% human generated responses) and validation is about 500k lines.

The text is already pre-processed and due to the BPE encoding, several combinations of ‘@@ ‘ can be found in text. For more info about this you can check the link listed above.

Observations: -  in some cases, after removing the ‘@@ ‘ combinations, some unexpected tokens could appear, several words being put together as a single token (ex: livingontheedge);
- due to large amount of gathered data, other language than english can appear;


Output: -  for evaluating the score on kaggle you should submit a csv file containing an indexing column and one more column which represent the probability of responses from validation file to be human generated;
- and example and other details could be found here: www.kaggle.com/c/human-or-machine-generated-text#evaluation


# Approaches:

# 1.Bag of words: 
 
First of all, I tried the well known bag of words representation using tf-idf as feature and Multinomial Bayes as classifier, after getting rid of stop words and useless tags.
Even though this method works really well on document topics classification, on our problem, the classifier performed poorly. 

From this, we can see that bots do not speak just on some particular subject/area, but rather just throwing random phrases.

# 2.Frequency of common words: 

Starting from the assumption that bots usually cannot reply properly to a given context, I took as features the number of word which appear in both context and response for each pair. For a better accuracy I used nltk to lemmatize the tokens in order to reduce the vocabulary. 
After training with SGD Logistic Regression and SVM with a rbf kernel I still could not get a good score. This may result due to the fact that a lot of words are misspelled and thus even if a word basically exists in both (context and response) it does not have the same form even if is lemmatized ( ex: good and gud ).

# 3. Similarity of words and phrases:  

After all, I tried to use a pre-trained word2vec model in order to use as features the phrases similarity and the best 3 similarities between each word from context and response. 
This scenario gave me the best roc_auc score after partially training it(just 500k random chosen samples) with an SVM.
